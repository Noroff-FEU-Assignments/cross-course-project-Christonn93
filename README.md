![image](/app/assets/index-page.png)

A simple overview of the use/purpose of this project.

## Description

This project is part of my time as a student at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media to become a front end dev.
I was tasked to use WP as a headless CMS, and use Netlify as the front-end for the project. I decided to create a blog where i collected some posts regarding conspiracy theories.

## Built With

You can list a the tech stack that you've used over here

- [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [JS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NoroffFEU/portfolio-1-example.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running

This is a static page. So to run this in the browser i would suggest to use visual studio code extension [Live Server Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=negokaz.live-server-preview)

```bash
Right click on the HTML page, choose live preview
```

## Contributing

This project have been made with some help from my fellow students at Noroff, some guidance from the teachers
